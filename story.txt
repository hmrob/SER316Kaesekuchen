Story:
I was walking along the street of Raesfeld when suddenly I smelled the delectable aroma of fresh brot (bread).
As it turns out, the nearby Baeckerei had just finished a batch of Apfelkuchen!
I was really hungry, so I hopped in my drop top Porsche down Hauptstrasse to the other side of town to buy some.
On the drive, a massive Schloss caught my eye so I flipped a u-turn and went to check it out.
I couldn't be happier when I found a Hund there wearing a Dirndel!
