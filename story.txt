Story:
I was walking along the street of Raesfeld when suddenly I smelled the delectable aroma of fresh brot (bread).
As it turns out, the nearby Baeckerei had just finished a batch of Apfelkuchen!
I was really hungry, so I hopped in my drop top Porsche down Hauptstrasse to the other side of town to buy some.
On the drive, a massive Schloss caught my eye so I flipped a u-turn and went to check it out.
I couldn't be happier when I found a Hund there wearing a Dirndel!
The Hund was so cute, I even considered entering him in a wettbewerbsfaehig costume competition.
However, I decided not to, because I couldn't find another hund to wear matching leinderhosen.
Instead, I thought I would give the Hund a treat so I tried to find a Baeckerei nearby.
However, I failed to find a Baeckerei nearby and instead found an Eltz in the distance.
When I approached Schloss Eltz, I realized that all the windows had Klimaanlages.
I was greated by a very loud and talented cover band playing songs from Rammstein in the Biergarten outside the Schloss Eltz iron gates.
